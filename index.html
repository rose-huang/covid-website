                            We conducted a <a href="https://forms.gle/EQw9oN6Dma1h2jbX7">10-question survey</a>
                            for college juniors and seniors to acquire the data used
                            for this visualization. The questions asked for basic demographic information,
                            employment status and impact, and sentiment regarding graduate school, economic outlook,
                            and mental health due to COVID-19. The survey was released on April 16th, 2020, and the
                            last responses used in the visualization were taken from April 29th, 2020. The survey
                            was shared primarily through social media to students at Columbia University, Princeton
                            University, UC Berkeley, and Georgetown University among other universities.

                            Of the 229 survey respondents, 62 are currently juniors and 167 are seniors during
                            the 2019-2020 school year. Science, Technology, Engineering, or Math (STEM) was the
                            most commonly indicated area of study, followed by Humanities, and then Economics,
                            Business, or Finance. The most popular industry was Finance, Consulting, or Business
                            with Technology or Software being a close second.

                            <p>
                              COVID-19 has forced schools to move online, businesses to close, and companies
                              to downsize. 10% of all our respondents have had their job/internship offers rescinded,
                              while 28% are still searching for opportunities.
                            </p>
                            <div class="infogram-embed" data-id="74e5b9fe-453a-41be-8721-685d5c02ecc6" data-type="interactive" data-title="Employment"></div><script>!function(e,i,n,s){var t="InfogramEmbeds",d=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement("script");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async");</script>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                              For juniors occupying more inessential positions within companies as summer interns,
                              their employment is significantly more impacted. Almost 21% of juniors have had their
                              internship offers rescinded, whereas only 6.6% of seniors saw rescinded offers. Furthermore,
                              53% of all employed juniors indicated that their internships will be completely virtual
                              compared to the 11% from their employed and graduating counterparts, whose jobs are much
                              more likely to be partially virtual.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Interestingly, more seniors are uncertain about their jobs, with 30% of employed seniors
                              responding that they are not sure and/or not notified of changes to the nature of their
                              employment compared to just 7% of corresponding, employed juniors. It seems that employers
                              are more reluctant to rescind full-time post-graduation positions or move them completely
                              online compared to internships, and may instead be undecided about the outlook for their new hires.

                            <p>
                              Most of our survey respondents plan to work in finance, consulting, and business, followed closely
                              by technology and software. These are also the industries where more people have obtained employment
                              as opposed to having had their offers rescinded or are still searching. Of the 80 students who plan
                              to work in finance, consulting, or business, 60% have obtained an internship or job. 65% of those
                              who wish to work in technology and software have similarly procured employment. Across each industry surveyed
                              with at least 10 overall responses, the average percentage of people who have found employment is about 39%.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              On the other hand, arts and entertainment, media, and marketing have the lowest percentage of employed
                              responses at 14%. These industries also have the most people who are still unemployed and searching – 66%
                              of those seeking opportunities in arts and entertainment, media, and marketing are still looking for jobs.
                              They are followed closely by the 62% of people planning to work in nonprofits who are still searching
                              for jobs.
                            </p>

                                  The entire performing arts industry as we knew it is on hold indefinitely, especially in New York.

                              Industries that saw the most rescinded offers, however, are not arts and entertainment, media, or marketing.
                              Out of the industries with at least 10 responses, government, public administration, and the education sectors
                              rescinded the most jobs by proportion,
                              with about 21% of those who plan to work in these industries indicating revoked offers. This is interesting
                              given that it has long been argued employees in the public sector <a href="https://www.aei.org/economics/lining-up-for-government-jobs/">enjoy considerably more job security</a>
                              than private workers. Healthcare, biotech, and pharmaceutics saw the lowest percentage of rescinded offers at
                              just 9%. Healthcare-related industries also saw above-average employment percentages with 42% of those who
                              want to work in these areas employed. The relative success of the healthcare fields within our survey align
                              with projections about the overall <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/hospitals-health-systems/industry-voices-healthcare-transactions-started-2020-strong-but-will-slow">stability of the healthcare industry</a>
                              amid today’s pandemic.

                                disproportionately harmed the travel and hospitality sectors</a>, and although we only have 6
                              respondents indicating they plan to work in these sectors, half have had their offers rescinded,
                              and no one has secured employment.

                              Most of our respondents are employed by large companies with more than 5,000 employees. It is no surprise
                              then that among both those who are employed and those who have had their offers rescinded, most plan(ned)
                              to work at the companies of over 5,000 people. Notably however, small to midsize companies of 50 to 500
                              workers rescinded the most offers after 5000+ companies, accounting for almost 30% of respondents whose
                              offers were revoked.

                              and STEM majors are employed compared to other majors. 67% of those who listed economics, business, and finance
                              as their area of study are still employed, and 60% of those who study STEM are employed.

                            <h3>Graduate School Interest</h3>
                            <p>
                            With the economic recession decreasing job prospects for current students, many
                            are turning to graduate school as a means to increase their employability.
                            For the majority of students responding to our survey, their desires to attend graduate
                            school were not directly impacted by COVID-19. However, 24% of students indicated that
                            their grad school interests have changed due to the impact of COVID-19 and the economic
                            recession, with more students now interested in graduate school who
                            weren't interested before the pandemic than the other way around.</p>
                            <div class="flourish-embed flourish-sankey" data-src="visualisation/2242020" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/2242020/embed">

                            <p><br>
                            Interest in graduate school appears to be impacted by current employment status, especially
                            for students indicating they weren’t interested before COVID-19 but now are. Of the 120
                            students who are currently employed, most did not change in their graduate schools
                            interests. Only 12.5% of employed students were previously not interested in graduate school
                            but now are. However, for the 65 students who are still searching for employment, 36.9%
                            became interested in graduate school when they weren’t before COVID-19. Similarly, 33.3% of
                            students with offers rescinded indicated that they are now interested in graduate school
                            when they weren’t before. For the 15 students who don’t plan on interning this summer
                            (junior) or working immediately after graduation (senior), over ½ have already applied
                            to graduate school and ⅓ have always been interested in applying.

                            Students planning on applying to graduate school have expressed concerns about the impact
                            of their grades and research on their applications, as well as increased competition and
                            decreased research funding. Students who have already applied are considering changing their
                            gap year plans before attending graduate school and are worried about COVID-19’s effect on
                            the experience of graduate programs if classes are held virtually.

                              There appears to be a correlation between mental health impacts of COVID-19
                              and employment status. 71% of students who had their job offers rescinded and
                              74% of students who are currently searching for a job indicated that they “agree”
                              or “strongly agree” that their mental health had significantly been impacted by
                              the pandemic. By contrast, 37% of employed students and 47% of students that do not
                              plan on working reported these same sentiments. These results echo student responses
                              that employment concerns are primary mental health stressors. Students also report
                              worries of the pandemic impacting their ability to access mental health support.

                              mental health. However, some students found that the changing job landscape actually relieved some

                          Students had differing opinions when it comes to how COVID-19 may impact employment opportunities in different industries.
                          One student who is studying economics, business, or finance and employed in the industry
                          of finance, consulting, or business believes that job security is something that university
                          students should have considered when deciding their major and industry before the recession.

                                 If you were worried about job security coming out of university, you would have majored

                                 If you’re worried about your offer getting rescinded, maybe you should have thought about job

                          <h1>Historical Recession Impacts on Graduates</h1>

                          <p>
                            College graduates in the Great Recession entered the workforce amid mass layoffs and
                            frozen hiring, with a stark absence of private sector jobs. In the current pandemic,
                            upperclassmen are experiencing many of the same difficulties as companies are forced to cancel
                            internship programs and rescind full-time offers. However, in contrast to the crisis in 2008/2009,
                            some large corporate employers today are working to continue with their planned graduate hires.
                            Notably, big name employers worry about risking their reputations by withdrawing offers to new
                            graduates. Some companies have chosen to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ee4bb3d0-8a2a-11ea-9dcb-fe6871f4145a">
                              furlough current first-year employees</a> but plan to onboard
                            new graduate hires in the fall.

                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Still yet, many employers across industries are having to reevaluate their recruiting practices in
                            light of the ongoing pandemic. A recent survey by <a href="https://www.naceweb.org/about-us/press/2020/employers-making-tough-decisions-with-internship-college-recruiting-programs/">
                              National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE)</a>
                            found that 19% of employer respondents have revoked internship offers and 3.5% have revoked full-time
                            offers for new graduates. However, 22% of employers are still considering revoking offers, so these
                            numbers remain subject to change. The survey also found that 78% of employers have made changes to their
                            internship program, with some opting to move to a virtual format and others shortening the timeframe by
                            delaying the internship start date. Employers who have cancelled their programs cite concerns of repelling
                            full-time recruits with poorly executed virtual internships and an inability to provide the same learning
                            experience virtually. Some concessions offered to this summer’s would-be interns include deferred programs
                            to next summer, guaranteed first-round interviews for full-time hiring, or even full-time offers post-graduation.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            As prior data indicates, the future looks bleak for those graduating into an economic downturn. Graduates
                            in a recession suffer from higher unemployment rates and lower salaries for 10 to 15 years after exiting
                            school —  an effect known as <i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/business/coronavirus-class-of-2020-jobs.html">“scarring.” </a></i>
                            According to the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2017407">Natural Center for Education Statistics (NCES),</a>
                            students who graduated in 2008 were roughly twice as likely to be unemployed as
                            students who graduated in 1993 or 2000. The median salary for humanities majors in 2008 was $30,000,
                            compared to a median of $35,000 for graduates in 2001.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Of those graduates of 2008 who did find work, 27% reported working in a field unrelated to their major,
                            compared to 22% of graduates in 2001 and 24% of graduates in 2004. According to our survey, many
                            current students are feeling similar pressure to pursue career options outside of their area of interest.

                             the number of new job listings posted between mid-February and mid-March
                            dropped 29% compared to the same period in 2019. Postings for retail stores dropped 14%, events jobs
